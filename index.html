 <h1>Rope</h1> 
 <p>A rope is a group of <a>yarns=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarn</a>, plies, fibres, or strands that are twisted or braided together into a larger and stronger form. Ropes have tensile strength and so can be used for dragging and lifting. Rope is thicker and stronger than similarly constructed cord, string, and twine.</p>
